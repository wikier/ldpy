    sioc:content """This ISWC2014 tutorial introduces into Apache Marmotta, an open
and extensible platform for Linked Data, which provides SPARQL 1.1 and LDP 1.0 support,
with many modules and extensions, hosted by the Apache Software Foundation. The tutorial
will show in a hands-on workshop how to setup Apache Marmotta, how to use it as a Linked
Data Platform server for publishing and maintaining datasets, and how to build and
extend Linked Data applications based on this platform. A specific focus will be on
Apache Marmottaâ€™s semantic media management capabilities with an introduction into the
SPARQL-MM multimedia querying extension."""@en .
